Revision history for perl module MooseX::Event

{{$NEXT}}

0.3.0_2   2012-07-29
- Move event wrapping out to Event::Wrappable

- Make coroutine support have lower overhead by storing the current event in
  a hash indexed by the coroutine rather then using on_enter and on_exit
  handlers.

- We drop the ability to use any sub ref that went into creating a listener
  as a key to it, this is because you know create your wrapped listener with
  the "event" helper and you can take a ref to it then.

v0.2.0    2011-09-04
- Split On::Event into MooseX::Event and ONE

v0.1.1    2011-08-19
- Fix issue that was stopping 5.8 from completing the tests.
- Added once, remove_listener, listeners, renamed trigger to emit, to match
  the node API.

v0.1.0    2011-08-17

- Initial release, timer only.
